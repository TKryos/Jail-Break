Final Project Game
this is a basic rogue-like game similar to The Binding of Isaac or Enter the Gungeon.
The goal of the game is to make it to defeat all the enemies and make it through 5 floors.
For each floor, there is a set layout to how the rooms are connected, and the location of the boss and item rooms are set in stone.
Each time the game is played, the room layouts and enemy composition of each room is randomised, and the items are randomised.
Click to throw knives, avoid enemy arrows, and collect items to become stronger.
